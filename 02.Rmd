## Better strategies lead to better results

Despite the wide acknowledgement and growing interest in the value of data and analytics, the consumer packaged goods industry (CPG) still lags other data-driven sectors when it comes to big data implementation and adopting real-time, predictive and prescriptive analytics. The CPG industry's current focus on relentless cost-cutting has forced companies to reduce headcount while relying on leaner teams to drive higher growth. Teams no longer have the time, resources, nor skills to formulate robust business strategies, leading to low performance and further cost cutting. With advances in big data processing and machine intelligence, automating the strategy development process could create significant competitive advantage for CPG companies by enhancing their ability to develop better strategies leading to better results. 


## Automating the strategy process

The strategy machine should not be viewed as a "strategist in a box" with an end-to-end solution providing all the answers. Instead, it serves to automate the tedious phases of the strategy process and provides "heavy-lifting" for the knowledge acquisition, situation analysis and opportunity identification phases. At this point, a human-in-the-loop (e.g., executive, subject matter experts) takes over to iterate and redefine the problem and/or objectives which should lead to more effective and efficient business strategy development and execution.

This project aims to build a specific use-case strategy machine for emerging-market strategy development and aims to automate the following key phases: 

1. Build knowledge base
2. Conduct situation analysis
3. Identify opportunities

Example methodologies include the use of natural language proceessing technology to mine vast troves of publicly available reports and articles on emerging markets, advanced data integration techniques to build a proprietary database integrating rich data sources such as The World Bank's Global Consumption database, Economist Intelligence Unit's Country database, Euromonitor's Global Market Research database, and Mintel's Innovation Trends & Insights database (all publicly available or via ischool library access). Finally, through advanced data analysis and visualization techniques, the strategy machine provides topline analysis for market attractiveness, size-of-prize estimate, opportunity ranking, competitive insights, and summarizes key recommendations for strategy development onto a "strategy on-a-page" output for executives.


## The Future: Human-Machine Strategists

The strategy machine has completely transformed how CPG companies develop and implement business strategy. What used to be a time consuming and human-resource intensive strategy development process, often delgated to a separate strategy function or outsourced to management consultants, has evolved into a critical must-build skill set for all organizations. Decision-makers across CPG companies will be trained on human-machine strategic capabilities, marrying human instints and expertise with AI-powered self-learning strategy machines to drive better decisions and results. Lean CPG companies no longer have to trade-off between robust strategy development and limited human resources.
