InstaFashion explores opportunities to transform and disrupt the online fashion shopping experience, while The Strategy Machine aims to automate the strategy development process in companies. I hope you enjoy reading more about my ideas and I welcome any feedback or opportunity to discuss these ideas further! Figure .: Pitch! 0.0.1 InstaFashion: See now, buy now! Social media has birthed a new generation of hyper-fashion-conscious consumers who have replaced fashion brands with influencers and magazines with Instagram as their source of inspiration. The problem facing this new generation of “see now, buy now” consumers is that the online path-to-purchase for fashion remains too brand-centric and does not integrate well with a influencer-centric discovery-led shopping experience. InstaFashion is a discovery-led fashion e-commerce experience that enables consumers to effortlessly shop the exact look from their favourite influencer’s social feeds while receiving personalised recommendations for similar styles and/or lower-priced alternatives. Through the use of big data, machine learning and predictive analytics, InstaFashion significantly shortens the online fashion path-to-purchase for today’s millennial and gen-Z fashionistas. 0.0.2 The Strategy Machine The strategy development process in consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies tend to follow a standardized framework with a set of key questions around where to play, how to win, and cost to play. With advances in big data processing and machine intelligence, automating parts of the strategy development process could create significant competitive advantage for lean CPG companies. We will pilot our efforts on a specific use-case strategy machine to aid in a company’s emerging markets strategy process by leveraging natural language processing, data integration, and predictive analytics technologies to mine and integrate rich sources of public data, extracting insights to provide a summary “strategy on-a-page” output for executives. The strategy machine has the potential to automate roughly half of standard strategy tasks resulting in significantly reduced cycle times and resource requirements. By marrying human instincts and expertise with AI-powered self-learning strategy machines, CPG companies will no longer have to trade-off between robust strategy development and limited human resources, which should ultimately drive towards better decisions and results.

["InstaFashion.html", "1 InstaFashion: See now, buy now! Meet the new trendsetters Bridging the gap from discovery to purchase Staying on-trend", " 1 InstaFashion: See now, buy now! Keywords fashion, social media, instagram, influencers, e-commerce, shoppable imagery, visual search, natural language processing, machine learning Meet the new trendsetters Social media has birthed a new generation of hyper-fashion-conscious consumers who are are less brand-obsessed and prefer to follow fashion influencers i.e., bloggers and social stars for their latest trends. Instagram, by far the top social platform for fashion aficionados, has in many respects replaced magazines as a source of inspiration for millions of fashionistas around the world. The problem facing this new generation of “see now, buy now” consumers is that the online path-to-purchase for fashion remains too brand-centric and does not integrate well with a influencer-centric discovery-led shopping experience. Going directly from their social feeds to shopping that “must-have look” still requires a few extra steps (and frustration!) such as researching product details (Instagram limits affiliate marketing), visiting separate brand/retailer websites to compile the look, and a limited ability to price compare. Now imagine a discovery-led fashion e-commerce experience that enabled consumers to effortlessly shop the exact look from their favourite influencer’s social feeds while receiving personalised recommendations for similar styles and/or lower-priced alternatives. The potential for transformation and disruption of the online fashion shopping experience is huge and has only just begun! Bridging the gap from discovery to purchase InstaFashion is an influencer-centric, shoppable fashion e-commerce platform that seamlessly integrates the process of discovery with a consumer’s online path-to-purchase. Consumers will be able to navigate from their social feeds to product information pages with “buy now” options for featured items, as well as receive recommendations for similar styles and/or lower-price alternatives. To satisfy our fashionista’s love for discovery, feeds and alerts will keep our users informed and up-to-date on top fashion influencers, designer news and emerging fashion trends, curated based on each user’s personalized profile and style preferences. By leveraging image recognition, natural language processing and machine learning technologies, InstaFashion turns social media posts into shoppable imagery by locating featured items and displaying product information and prices from related e-commerce sites. Images that score high style-match percentages are also displayed to offer the consumer more style or pricing options e.g., instead of only displaying luxury brand items, InstaFashion offers alternative solutions at lower price points to achieve the same look. Predictive methods are applied against the vast dataset of consumers’ on-site interactions and shopping behaviors to model insights for top sellers, emerging trends, and to further optimize the discovery-to-purchase experience. nstaFashion leverages existing open- source technologies such as Sci-Kit learn for machine learning, neural network library Caffe2 for image feature extraction, and a blended recommendation model that combines various predictive methods (e.g., Support- vector machines, K-nearest neighbor, Random forests, etc). InstaFashion is designed as a mobile-first Instagram partner app (such as Like2Buy) that aims to further connect influencers and their followers via a brand-agnostic e-commerce platform. Fashion influencers are able to better monetize their social media feeds by adding an InstaFashion link in their profile converting their Instagram posts into a shoppable gallery. By clicking on this single link, consumers are taken to a gallery of their influencer’s instagram photos and videos (now with shoppable product tags) where they can continue browsing, price compare and/or complete their purchases. Although there are several similar solutions such Like2Buy and Shopify, they are mostly designed for brands/retailers/businesses rather than for influencers. Staying on-trend Through the use of big data, machine learning and predictive analytics, InstaFashion significantly shortens the online fashion path-to-purchase for today’s millennial and gen-Z fashionistas. Some of the potential challenges InstaFashion faces include: high acquisition costs of influencers to get to critical mass, competition from B2B sites such as Like2Buy, Instagram as they continue to monetize their offerings with shoppable tags and buy buttons, and Amazon who has recently announced a strategic push into fashion. By focusing on a single vertical (fashion) and targeted consumer/stakeholder space (highly fashion conscious millennial/gen-Z and their influencers), InstaFashion has the potential to compete against bigger but more generalized platforms who are likely unable to replicate the same immersive shopping experience optimized for today’s fashionistas.

["strategymachine.html", "2 The Strategy Machine Better strategies lead to better results Automating the strategy process The Future: Human-Machine Strategists", " 2 The Strategy Machine Keywords business strategy, automation, consumer packaged goods, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, visualization Better strategies lead to better results Despite the wide acknowledgement and growing interest in the value of data and analytics, the consumer packaged goods industry (CPG) still lags other data-driven sectors when it comes to big data implementation and adopting real-time, predictive and prescriptive analytics especially in the strategy development process. Recent focus on relentless cost-cutting has forced CPG companies to reduce headcount while relying on leaner teams to drive higher growth. Teams no longer have the time, resources, nor skills to formulate robust business strategies, leading to low performance and further cost cutting. The strategy development process in CPG companies often follow a standardized framework with a set of key questions around where to play (market/segment attractiveness), how to win (company/product’s right to win), and cost to play (business case). With advances in big data processing and machine intelligence, automating parts of the strategy development process could create significant competitive advantage for lean CPG companies by enhancing their ability to develop better strategies which could lead to better results. Automating the strategy process The strategy machine aims to automate specific tasks (marked by * below) within each of the key phases of a typical strategy development process: Phase 1: Where to play Market, business and consumer knowledge acquistion* Extract market, consumer and competitor insights* Forecast and predict future market growth* Identify and rank potential growth opportunities* Phase 2: How to win Review where to play analyses and refine strategic choices Rank strategic choices against company/product’s right to win and initial feasibility assessment Prioritize growth choices based on weighted set of decision criteria* Phase 3: Cost to play Conduct in-depth feasibility assessment Develop business plan and financials for strategic choice Obtain senior stakeholder alignment and buy-in on final proposal Let’s look at a more specific use-case of developing a strategy machine for a company or brand’s emerging markets strategy process. By leveraging natural language processing technology, the strategy machine is able to mine vast troves of publicly available relevant emerging market reports and articles. Advanced data integration techniques can then be used to build a proprietary database integrating rich data sources such as The World Bank’s Global Consumption database, Economist Intelligence Unit’s Country database, Euromonitor’s Global Market Research database, and Mintel’s Innovation Trends &amp; Insights database (all publicly available or via ischool library access). Finally, through advanced data and predictive analytics, the strategy machine can extract topline analysis and insights around emerging market attractiveness, size-of-prize estimates, country/segment opportunity ranking, competitive insights, and summarize key recommendations for strategy development onto a “strategy on-a-page” output for executives. This live output can then be used to inform phases 2 &amp; 3 and act as a basis for iteration to refine the business team’s assumptions. The Future: Human-Machine Strategists The strategy machine has the potential to automate roughly half of standard strategy tasks resulting in significantly reduced cycle times and resource requirements. What used to be a time consuming and human-resource intensive strategy development process, often delgated to a separate strategy function or outsourced to costly management consultants, will evolve into a critical human-machine integrated process marrying human instincts and expertise with AI-powered self-learning strategy machines. That said, the strategy machine should not be viewed as a “strategist in a box” with an end-to-end solution providing all the answers. Instead, it serves to automate the mundane and often time-consuming tasks of the strategy process namely knowledge acquisition, situation analysis and opportunity identification. At this point, a human-in-the-loop (e.g., business executive, subject matter experts) takes over to iterate and redefine the problem and/or objectives which should lead to more effective and efficient business strategy development and execution. The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) chart below serves as a vision for full human-machine integration in corporate strategy development. Looking ahead, it is my hope that lean CPG companies will not have to trade-off between robust strategy development and limited human resources, which should ultimately drive towards better decisions and results.
