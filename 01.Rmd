## Meet the new trendsetters

Fashion brands have always recognized the power of endorsement by celebrities and supermodels, however, a more recent phenomenon has been the rise in power of influencers.  Fashion influencers i.e., bloggers, stylists and social stars, many with followers in the millions, are currently the most in-demand for brand partnerships. Social media has fueled a new generation of connected hyper-fashion-conscious consumers who are less brand-obsessed and care more about achieving a must-have look and style of the moment. Instagram, by far the top social platform for fashion aficionados, has in many respects replaced magazines as a source of inspiration for millions of fashionistas around the world. The problem facing this new generation of “see now, buy now” consumers is that the online path-to-purchase for fashion remains too brand-centric and does not integrate well with a discovery-focused shopping experience. Going directly from their social feeds to shopping that “must-have look” still requires a few extra steps (and frustration!) such as researching product details (Instagram limits affilitate marketing), visiting separate brand/retailer websites to compile the look, and a limited ability to price compare. 

## Bridging the gap from "like" to "buy"

InstaFashion aims to transform the online fashion shopping experience through an influencer-centric, shoppable social platform that seamlessly integrates the process of discovery with a consumer's online path-to-purchase. Consumers will be able to effortlessly navigate from their social feeds to product information pages with "buy now" options for featured items, as well as recommendations for similarly styled and/or lower-priced alternatives. To satisfy our fashionista’s love for discovery, fashionfeed and alerts will keep our users informed and up-to-date on top fashion influencers, designer news and emerging fashion trends curated based on each user's personalized profile and style preferences.

By leveraging state-of-the-art visual search and machine learning technologies, InstaFashion transforms point-of-inspiration posts on social media into shoppable imagery by locating featured items and displaying product information and prices from related seller sites. Images that score high on style-match percentages are also displayed to offer the consumer more style and/or price options. Predictive methods can be applied to consumers’ on-site activities and shopping behaviors to recommend top sellers, emerging fashion trends, and further personalize their path-to-purchase. Brands and retailers are already experimenting with visual search and image recognition systems such as Cortexica's FindSimilar and ExactMatch technologies offering automatic product identification of images uploaded by consumers. Given the fact that the technologies required already exist, the key differentiator and critical success factor for InstaFashion will be our ability to offer a unique shopper experience that is influencer-centric and discovery focused.     

## Staying on-trend

InstaFashion has transformed the online fashion shopping experience for today’s millennial and gen-Z fashionistas.  What started out as a solution to an online path-to-purchase pain point, InstaFashion has evolved into a vibrant social platform for fashion aficionados and has transformed the way we discover, experience and shop for the latest looks and trends. Through the use of big data, machine learning and predictive analytics, InstaFashion has further increased accessibility and democratization of fashion trends to the masses.

The challenges ahead are daunting as online and multichannel retailers rush to invest in the latest fashion technologies and incumbent social media platforms such as Instagram and Pinterest continue to monetize their offerings with shoppable tags and buy buttons. To stay on-trend, InstaFashion will have to continuously innovate to deliver more personalized and intimate shopping solutions for tomorrow's fashionistas.
