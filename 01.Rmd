## Meet the new trendsetters

Fashion brands have always recognized the power of endorsement by celebrities and supermodels, however, a more recent phenomenon has been the rise in power of influencers.  Fashion influencers i.e., bloggers, stylists and social stars, many with followers in the millions, are currently the most in-demand for brand partnerships. Instagram, by far the top social platform for fashion aficionados, has in many respects replaced magazines as a source of inspiration for millions of fashionistas around the world. Social media has fueled a new generation of connected hyper-fashion-conscious consumers who are less brand-obsessed and care more about staying on-trend and achieving a certain look and style of the moment. The problem facing this new generation of “see now, buy now” fashion consumers is that the online path-to-purchase is often confusing and convoluted. Going directly from their Instagram feed to buying that “must-have look” online still requires a few extra steps (and frustration!) such as finding out the specifics of the items (influencers are not allowed to post product links on their Instagram feeds), searching brands/retailer websites to visit to compile the look, and limited ability to price compare.  The potential for transformation and disruption of the online fashion shopping experience is huge and has only just begun.    

## Bridging the gap from "like" to "buy"

InstaFashion aims to transform the online fashion shopping experience by providing a consumer-centric platform that seamlessly connects fashion consumers to top influencers and  sellers.  Consumers will be able to effortlessly navigate from their Instagram feed to a “shop this look” landing page offering purchase options for both the featured items and similarly styled options at lower price points, as well as recommendations for other “must-have looks” shopped by similar consumers. To satisfy our fashionista’s love for trend discovery, fashionfeed and alerts will keep our fashionistas informed and up-to-date on top fashion influencers, designer news and emerging fashion trends curated based on the fashionista’s profile and style preferences. 

By leveraging image recognition, natural language processing and machine learning technology, InstaFashion scans the consumer’s “point of inspiration” likes on Instagram to locate the exact items and displays prices from the items’ related seller sites. Images that have a high style-match percentages are also displayed to offer the consumer more style or pricing options e.g., instead of only displaying luxury brands, InstaFashion offers alternative shopping solutions at lower price points to achieve the same look. Predictive methods are applied against the vast dataset of consumers’ browsing and shopping behaviors on the site to model insights for top sellers, emerging trends, and further optimize the path-to-purchase.  InstaFashion leverages existing open-source technologies such as Sci-Kit learn for machine learning, neural network library Caffe for image feature extraction, and a blended recommendation model that combines various predictive methods (e.g., Support-vector machines, K-nearest neighbor, Random forests, etc). 

## Staying on-trend


InstaFashion has transformed the online fashion shopping experience for today’s millennial and gen-Z fashionistas.  What started out as a solution to a consumer pain point of not being able to access the content they want beyond Instagram, InstaFashion has evolved into a vibrant community of fashion aficionados and has transformed the way we experience, shop and crowdsource trends for the fashion industry.  Through the use of big data, machine learning and predictive analytics, InstaFashion has further increased accessibility and democratization of fashion trends to the masses. The challenges ahead are daunting as Instagram chooses to launch their own fashion e-commerce platform. As younger fashionistas migrate to other platforms, InstaFashion will also have to adapt and stay agile to continue being relevant to tomorrow’s fashionistas.
